### 🇸🇪 Stockholm: City of Water

- Wandered through **Gamla Stan** with its ochre-colored houses
- Took a boat ride in the **Stockholm archipelago**
- Enjoyed the **Vasa Museum** and cozy cafés around Södermalm

### 🛳 Overnight Ferry to Tallinn

The ferry was like a mini-cruise — karaoke, buffets, and snow outside.

### 🇪🇪 Tallinn: Medieval and Magical

- Explored **Toompea Hill**, old walls, and narrow alleys
- Tried **Estonian black bread** and salmon soup
- Enjoyed the view from **Kohtuotsa platform**
