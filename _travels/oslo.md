Oslo greeted me with fresh snow, crisp air, and wide open spaces. I only had a day, but the experience was complete in its own way.

### 🧊 What I Did

- Climbed the roof of the **Oslo Opera House** for panoramic views over the fjord
- Walked through **Karl Johans Gate** and **Royal Palace Gardens**
- Took a ferry across the frozen harbor

The light in Oslo during winter feels like it’s painted in watercolors. Calm, beautiful, and a bit surreal.
