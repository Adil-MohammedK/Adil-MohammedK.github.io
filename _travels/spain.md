- Tapas night under the stars

### 🔥 Seville

- Morning in **Plaza de España** — pure architectural poetry
- Watched a flamenco performance in **Santa Cruz**
- Climbed the **Giralda Tower** for sweeping views

### 🌊 Barcelona

- Marvelled at **Sagrada Família** and **Park Güell**
- Relaxed on **Barceloneta Beach**
- Tapas crawl in **El Born** and Gothic Quarter

> “Spain lives on its streets — in rhythm, color, and late-night laughter.”
