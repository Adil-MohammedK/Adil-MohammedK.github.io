Copenhagen in February is a blend of cozy cafés, frosty canals, and quiet winter streets. My two-day solo trip was filled with unexpected warmth, both from the city and its people.

### Day 1: Castles and Canals

- Explored **Christiansborg Palace** and **Rosenborg Castle**
- Took a canal tour in Nyhavn, even though it was snowing!
- Tried traditional **smørrebrød** (open-faced sandwiches) and **Gløgg** (mulled wine)

### Day 2: Bikes, Design, and Chill

Visited the **Designmuseum Danmark**, walked along **Strøget**, and warmed up in a little café near **Tivoli**.
